NAME
    Dancer::Template::Mason - Mason wrapper for Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.003003

SYNOPSIS
      # in 'config.yml'
      template: 'mason'

      # in the app
 
      get '/foo', sub {
        template 'foo' => {
            title => 'bar'
        };
      };

    Then, on "views/foo.mason":

        <%args>
        $title
        </%args>

        <h1><% $title %></h1>

        <p>Mason says hi!</p>

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the HTML::Mason templating system.

    In order to use this engine, set the template to 'mason' in the
    configuration file:

        template: mason

HTML::Mason::Interp CONFIGURATION
    Parameters can also be passed to the HTML::Mason::Interp interpreter via
    the configuration file, like so:

        engines:
            mason:
                default_escape_flags: ['h']

    If unspecified, "comp_root" defaults to the "views" configuration
    setting or, if it's undefined, to the "/views" subdirectory of the
    application.
